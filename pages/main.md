### About me

I'm currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), where I'm supervised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) in 2018.

My research interests focus on distributed systems and cloud computing, including machine learning systems, distributed storage and serverless computing.
