### About me

I'm currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), where I'm supervised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) in 2018.

My research interests cover the board area of distributed systems and cloud computing, with special focus on machine learning systems and serverless computing. 

I'm on the job market. [**Curriculum vitae**](https://mincyu.github.io/archive/CV_Minchen.pdf).

<!-- Here is my CV.  -->
