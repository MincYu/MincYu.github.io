I am always looking for students with strong motivation to work on computer systems research. Our group has multiple openings for graduate students and research interns. If you are interested, please drop me an email along with your CV, transcripts, and any other documents that can well demonstrate your research capability and potential.

### Graduate Students (2025 Fall)

**[2025/03]** 1-2 openings for PhD/MPhil students starting 2025 Fall. What I look for in candidates:
- Major in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artifical Intelligence, or other related fields at high-level universities (e.g., 985/211)
- Good academic performance and solid foundation in programming
- Prior experiences in research, competitions, or open-source projects is highly valued (a plus but not required)

Our research group has established long-term collaborations with leading industry partners (e.g., Huawei, Alibaba, etc). As a graduate student, you will have the opportunity to: 
- Collaborate with industry experts and gain access to cutting-edge resources
- Tackle real-world challenges in large-scale production systems


### Research Assistants

**[2025/03]** multiple RA openings for research projects on serverless computing and machine learning systems. The requirements for RA candidates include:
- Strong programming and system building skills
- Availability for a 3+ months on-site internship at CUHK-Shenzhen

RAs will work closely with other group members on cutting-edge research projects and contribute to papers targeting top-tier venues.
