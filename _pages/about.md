<!-- ## About me -->

I am an Assistant Professor in [School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Prior to that, I received my PhD degree from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), where I was advised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn).

### Research Interests

My research interests cover the broad area of cloud computing and distributed systems, with a special focus on serverless computing, big data and machine learning systems. Our current research projects include:
<!-- I am particularly interested in identifying fundamental system challenges in these areas and investigating system solutions that are efficient and easy to use.  -->

- **Scalable ML and LLM inference systems**
- **Intelligent cluster management on heterogeneous resources** 
- **Usable and efficient serverless computing platforms**

<!-- - Big data analytics and caching: [CrystalPerf](../files/crystalperf-atc21.pdf) (ATC'21), [RepBun](../files/repbun-infocom20.pdf) (INFOCOM'20) -->


### Prospective Students and Current Openings

I am looking for self-motivated graduate students and research assistants (RAs) to work with me on the above topics. Please see [here](https://mincyu.github.io/joinus) for the details.
