<!-- ## About me -->

I am an Assistant Professor in School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ). Prior to that, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow and received my PhD degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), advised by  Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn).

My research interests cover the broad area of cloud computing and distributed systems. My current research focuses on building **next-generation serverless computing platforms** that are usable and generally applicable, and developing efficient and scalable **big data and machine learning systems** in the cloud.

<span style="color:red">I am looking for motivated PhD students (2024 Fall) and research assistants to work with me. If you are interested, please feel free to drop me an email along with your CV and transcripts.</span>
