<!-- ## About me -->

I am an Assistant Professor in [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). Prior to that, I was a Post-Doctoral Fellow and received my PhD degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), advised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn).

My research interests cover the broad area of cloud computing and distributed systems. I am particularly interested in advancing serverless computing platforms and designing usable, efficient and scalable systems for big data and machine learning workloads. Recent research projects are as follows.

- Scalable ML inference: [FaaSwap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03622), [Gillis](../files/gillis-icdcs21.pdf) (ICDCS'21), [MArk](../files/mark-atc19.pdf) (ATC'19)
- LLM serving: [CaraServe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11240)
- Usable, efficient serverless computing : [Pheromone](../files/pheromone-nsdi23.pdf) (NSDI'23)
- Data analytics and caching: [CrystalPerf](../files/crystalperf-atc21.pdf) (ATC'21), [RepBun](../files/repbun-infocom20.pdf) (INFOCOM'20)

<!-- My current research focuses on building **next-generation serverless computing platforms** that are usable and generally applicable, and developing efficient and scalable **big data and machine learning systems** in the cloud. -->



**I am looking for self-motivated graduate students (PhD/MPhil) and research assistants (RA) to work with me. If you are interested, please feel free to drop me an email along with your CV and transcripts.**
