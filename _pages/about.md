## About Me

I received my Ph.D. degree from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), where I was supervised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). Prior to that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn) in 2018.

My research interests cover the board area of distributed systems and cloud computing, with special focus on machine learning systems and serverless computing.
